2026 Winter Games Day 12: Bobsled

Given an array representing the weights of the athletes on a bobsled team and a number representing the weight of the bobsled, determine whether the team is eligible to race.

    The length of the array determines the team size: 1, 2 or 4 person teams.
    All given weight values are in kilograms (kg).

The bobsled (sled by iteself) must have a minimum weight of:

    162 kg for a 1-person team
    170 kg for a 2-person team
    210 kg for a 4-person team

The total weight of the bobsled (athletes plus sled) must not exceed:

    247 kg for a 1-person team
    390 kg for a 2-person team
    630 kg for a 4-person team

Return "Eligible" if the team meets all the requirements, or "Not Eligible" if the team fails to meet one or more of the requirements.
