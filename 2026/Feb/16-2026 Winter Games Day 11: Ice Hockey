2026 Winter Games Day 11: Ice Hockey

Given an array of 6 ice hockey teams and their records after the round robin games, determine the match-ups for the semi-final round.

    Each array item will have a team and their record in the format "TEAM: W-OTW-OTL-L". Where:
        "W" is the number of wins in regulation, worth 3 points each
        "OTW" is the number of overtime wins, worth 2 points each
        "OTL" is the number of overtime losses, worth 1 point each
        "L" is the number of losses, worth 0 points each

For example, "FIN: 2-2-1-0" would have 11 points after adding up their record.

Find the total number of points for each team and return "The semi-final games will be (1st) vs (4th) and (2nd) vs (3rd).". For example, "The semi-final games will be FIN vs SWE and CAN vs USA."
